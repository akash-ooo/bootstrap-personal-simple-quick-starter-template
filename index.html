      <h2 class="display-4 mb-3">Ibn al-Haytham</h2>
      <p>Alhazen is best known for his work on optics and vision. He wrote extensively on the subject, including his most famous work, "Kitab al-Manazir" (The Book of Optics). In this book, he challenged the prevailing theories of vision proposed by Greek scholars like Euclid and Ptolemy. Alhazen conducted experiments and observations to understand how light travels through different mediums and how the eye perceives images.</p>
      <p>One of Alhazen's most significant contributions to optics was his explanation of how vision occurs through the process of light rays entering the eye and forming images on the retina. He also accurately described the properties of reflection and refraction, laying the foundation for modern optics.</p>
      <p>In addition to his work in optics, Alhazen made important contributions to the fields of mathematics and astronomy. He developed new methods for solving mathematical problems, including a technique for finding the sum of integral cubes, which later influenced the work of European mathematicians like Pierre de Fermat.</p>
      <p>Alhazen's scientific achievements were not limited to theory alone; he emphasized the importance of empirical observation and experimentation, a principle that would later become central to the scientific method. His work had a profound impact on later scholars in the Islamic world and beyond, influencing the development of optics, mathematics, and the scientific method in Europe during the Renaissance.</p>
      <p>Alhazen's legacy as a Muslim scientist continues to be celebrated today, highlighting the rich tradition of scientific inquiry and innovation in the Islamic world during the medieval period. His contributions to optics and mathematics laid the groundwork for many advancements in science and technology, making him one of the most influential scientists in history.</p>
